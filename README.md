# Ask me anything session
This repository is only to collect questions for my upcoming "Ask me anything" show on Twitch.

I'll accept questions about C#, .NET Core, ASP.NET Core, ASP.NET, HTML, JavaScript, CSS and related topics as well as topics about the .NET developer community

Feel free to file a new issue in case you have any questions about .NET Core, ASP.NET Core and related topics: https://github.com/JuergenGutschOnTwitch/AskMeAnythingSession/issues/new
